The Science Philanthropy Alliance is a community of funders who work together to inspire new, emerging and current philanthropists to dedicate a portion of their philanthropy to basic science.

This site was built using Wordpress, and utilizes CSS Flexbox to achieve many of the responsive design elements that are present on the site.
