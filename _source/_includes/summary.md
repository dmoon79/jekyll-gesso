Front-end web developer with over 12 years of work experience. Extensive background with JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SASS, and PHP based content management systems. I’ve also accumulated project management experience, and have freelanced via my own consulting company for several years.

My recent work has been on the agency side of the development spectrum, where I love seeking out and implementing efficient, and reusable systems. When possible I try to refactor code for team reusability and templating purposes. I contribute extensively to the development of our team’s base theme for the Drupal and Wordpress communities.

Some of my personal development projects include a music suggestion engine and blog, a Wordpress plugin updater that encapsulates each update in it’s own git commit, and a Wordpress starter theme that adheres to SMACSS best practices and provides tons of Grunt-based task automation.

Highlights

- Web Development (Javascript, PHP, HTML, SASS/CSS)
