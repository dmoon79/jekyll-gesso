I'm currently living in Seattle, with my beautiful wife, where I work as a web developer.

When I'm not making websites you can find me DJing and digging up rare and underground music from around the world that I curate at [Cuerators.com](http://cuerators.com){:target="_blank"}. If you want to download some of my funky mixes visit my [Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/dmoon/sets/the-mixes){:target="_blank"}

I took a personality test and it indicated that I'm a [ESTP-A](http://www.truity.com/personality-type/ESTP){:target="_blank"}. I concur.

I travel, I cook, and I eat (I'm a midwesterner). I really enjoy being around great people, and having good times.

I am an avid Chicago sports fan (Da Bears, Da Bulls and Da Hawks (baseball is boring)...amen).
